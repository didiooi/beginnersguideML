# Getting Started with Data Science and AI
*v1.0 October-22-2017*  
Content: Resources (hyperlinked!), Background, (very) Basic Introduction.

## My Long-Short Summary
Like me, a lot of you are probably **NOT** coming from a computer science or applied statistics background. One of the most effective way to pick up Data Science (especially Machine Learning and Deep Learning) is to: 
1. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE *and* LEARN **at the same time**
2. Post your repositories (project) on [Github](https://www.github.com) & [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
3. Start participating in local [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) and/or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) to try and solve real data.

The list above is not necessarily in order. Half of the people I talked to are more comfortable with 1, 2 and then 3. Which is akin to a traditional education (the top-down approach). Some people are a bit more adventurous, starting with 3, then 2 then 1 (like myself)! I decide to visit my first hackathon [Houston Hackathon](http://houstonhackathon.com/) this year to find out what it is all about - only to get pulled in one project, and then another [one](https://www.hackathon.com/event/geophysics-hackathon-2017-36373291494)! If you like learning-on-the-go and love solving problems and don't mind being thrown into an unknown pit, then this is the way to go.

The reason why I said **practice and learn** 'at the same time' is that:
- PRACTICING allows you to apply the **TOOLS** that you need to solve your data science problem with existing repositories without wasting time to start from ground up. I believe practicing it this way from top-down is much faster than the traditional learning we have all been exposed to (especially me!)
- LEARNING is crucial to understand **WHY** did you apply the tools that you did i.e. why did you choose the algorithms and the background math that shaped it. You're not a Data Scientist if you're just the end-user of tools!

NEXT STEP, if you live in medium/big cities - go out of your comfort zone and meet other people in the AI/DS field, in your area. Use [MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/) or [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) whereby 99% of these free events/meetups cater to like-minded people of various degree of experience! *If there isn't one, then be the one to organize the first in your area!*
From finding out about Meetup in the summer 2017 *(yes I am the late bloomer)*, I now regularly go to [Houston Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Science/), [Houston Machine Learning](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Machine-Learning/), [Houston Energy Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Energy-Data-Science-Meetup/) and [Houston Data Visualization](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Visualization-Meetup/) groups and I definitely learned a lot by talking to people, asking questions, or sitting in lectures. 

(**Be warned** that it can be intimidating at first, but understand and expect that you will leave from first few Meetups with 0.1 to 5% comprehension of the whole learning experience and that is COMPLETELY NORMAL. Keep an open mind, be eager to learn and you will realize how that percentage of comprehension grows over time. It is easier and faster than just learning the theoretical background from books and courses but most importantly, it will reinforce your theoretical learning.)

*(At the more recent SEG Geophysics Hackathon)*

Last but not least, learn how data science and its architecture are being applied in the **REAL WORLD**. Start by figuring out which **industries you are interested in**, research about how they are integrating traditional methods and products with advanced analytics and emerging technologies into their existing or future products, workflow or supply chain etc. Then VOILA! Your journey begins!


## Background
People often get mixed-up with the term Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and how it relates to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Here is one diagram I made *(inspired from Nvidia)*:
![](https://github.com/didiooi/beginnersguideML/blob/master/AI%20ML%20DL.png)
*(In short, Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which is a subset of AI)*

There is also another way to view this: **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**. Supervised Learning includes Machine Learning while Unsupervised Learning includes Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.  

### Behind the Hype: Terminologies Explained...

- Data Science: Extraction of knowledge and information from data, using integrated ideas from Mathematics, Statistics, Machine Learning, Computer Science, and Subject Matter Expertise (SME).
- Big Data: Unstructured data from multiple sources arriving at an alarming **Velocity, Volume and Variety** and in format in which meaningful value and information is not leveraged from (yet).  
- Machine Learning (ML): A field in computer science whereby the algorithm has the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  
- Statistical Learning: Branch of applied statistics recently emerge in response to ML, emphasizing statistical models and assessment of uncertainty.  
- Deep Learning (DL): A computational method for implementing machine learning using artificial neural network by building multiple layers of abstraction to solve complex semantic problems.

 *(The goal is to be a **unicorn**.)*

 All of the terminologies are very similar but have **different emphases**.

 
## Programming Language
[**Python**](https://www.python.org/) is the fastest growing language because of how dynamic and readable it is, so I'd suggest getting started with the basics of it.  
Read '[Python overtakes R, becomes the leader in Data Science, Machine Learning platforms](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/python-overtakes-r-leader-analytics-data-science.html)'

**Important Python Tools, Libraries**  
[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)  
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)  
[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)  

## Practice 
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Run through [tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/Tutorials) and start with solving the [Titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) with Machine Learning! 
- Forking from existing and popular [GitHub](https://www.github.com) repositories and play with it!

## Resources for Machine Learning
Andrew Ng's Stanford (now Google's) [**Machine Learning** course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is a great place to start if you already have a strong science and math background. For the theoretical background behind Statistical Learning, which is an advanced branch of statistics invented in conjunction with Machine Learning, your best bet will be [**Introduction to Statistical Learning**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).  
If you want the *classic* beginner's guide to ML and needs some refresher with math, definitely go to Chris Bishop's [**Pattern Recognition**](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf).  
If you're feeling extra adventurous and would love to learn the theoretical and mathematical background, try Hastie's [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

### Resources for Deep Learning
- For **Deep Learning**, there is no other place to start with than Ian Goodfellow et al's [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book.
- Deep Learning course by Ng at [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
- Jeremy Howard's [Fast AI](http://course.fast.ai/)
- [Neural Network Zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/) - cheat sheet containing most NN architectures  
- [Neural Network playground with TensorFlow](http://playground.tensorflow.org) - a web app that lets you play with a real neural network (NN) running in your browser and click buttons and tweak parameters to see how it works. If you are unsure of what pressing all that buttons mean, read [Google's blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/07/understanding-neural-networks-with-tensorflow-playground)

## News and Forums for Data Science and AI
1. [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/)  
2. Following the right people on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/didiooi/following) (Most of the people I follow on my Twitter are at the forefront of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning realm)  
3. [Quora on Machine Learning](https://www.quora.com/topic/Machine-Learning): for pretty intelligent discussion
4. [Medium](https://medium.com) Short reads on all sorts of topics, including ML, DL, robotics (make sure to personalize your feed first)    
5. Reddit for hype-and-updates on [/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)

## Data Visualization
Now that you have the tools and resources, it is important to remember that [data visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization) is also an important front-end component to Data Science. This is because EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION of data is crucial to all the work you have spent your blood, sweat and tears on, especially when you are sharing the results with your boss, stakeholders and/or clients. 
The lack thereof is what gave rise to the other buzzword - **Business Intelligence** which includes tools like Microsoft Power BI, TIBCO Spotfire, Tableau (which are basically Excel on steroids).
Inspired by Microsoft's Data Summit 2017 keynote by [Alberto Cairo](http://www.thefunctionalart.com) (modern data viz guru to [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte)) - here is a short read [6 Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-fundamental-principles-data-visualization-didi-sher-ooi/) summarising it.

## Help and Forums
[StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/): to ask for help in any data science or programming problems  

## Key Takeaway
The key takeaways that I have learned:
1. You do not need to know advanced coding to get into Data Science or Machine Learning etc, do it from top-down
2. Data Science and its tools is **NOT magic**! You should remain skeptical and vigilant. Good data and proper internal validation is required.

## Questions
Yes, this is what I decided to do on a Sunday morning after receiving requests from friends on how they can get started in the AI field over the last few weeks, so forgive any grammatical errors. Do let me know if you have any questions, at didi.ooi@bristol.ac.uk or at message me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didiooi).
