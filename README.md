# Self-Taught Data Science and Machine Learning
*v1.0 October-22-2017*

## My short story of how to be a part of this AI breakthrough
Like me, a lot of you are probably **not** coming from a computer science or statistics background. One of the most effective ways to pick up Data Science (especially Machine Learning and Deep Learning) is to: 
1. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE *and* LEARN **at the same time**
2. Post your repositories (project) on [Github](https://www.github.com) & [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
3. Start participating in local [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) and/or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) to try and solve real data.

The list above is not necessarily in order, but most people I talked are more comfortable with 1, 2 and then 3.  
Some people are a bit more adventurous, started with 3, then 2 then 1 (like myself)! I decided to visit my first hackathon [Houston Hackathon](http://houstonhackathon.com/) this year to find out what it is all about - only to get pulled in one a project, and then another [one](https://www.hackathon.com/event/geophysics-hackathon-2017-36373291494)! If you like learning-on-the-go and love solving problems and don't mind being thrown into an unknown pit and solve a problem, then this is the way to go.

The reason why I said 'at the same time' is that:
- PRACTICE allows you to apply **tools** that you need to solve your data science problem with existing repositories without wasting time to start from ground up. I believe practicing it this way from top-down is much faster than the traditional learning we have all been exposed to (especially me!)
- LEARNING is crucial to understand **why** did you apply the tools that you did i.e. why did you choose the algorithms you did.

At the same time, if you can and you live in big cities - go out of your comfort zone and go meet other people in the field in your area using [MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/) or [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com). 
From finding out about Meetup in the summer 2017, I now regularly go to [Houston Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Science/), [Houston Machine Learning](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Machine-Learning/), [Houston Energy Data Science](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Energy-Data-Science-Meetup/) and [Houston Data Visualization](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Visualization-Meetup/) groups and I definitely learned a lot by talking to people or sitting in lectures. Be warned that it can be intimidating at first, but understand and expect that you will leave from first few Meetups with 0.1 to 5% of comprehension of the whole learning experience and that is COMPLETELY NORMAL. Keep an open mind, be eager to learn and you will realize how that percentage of comprehension grows over time. This is all part of learning. It is way easier and faster than just learning the theories in books or courses but most of all, it will reinforce your theoretical learning.

Last but not least, learn how data science and its architecture are being applied in the **REAL WORLD**. Start by figuring out which **industries you are interested in**, find out about what or how they are integrating traditional methods and products with advanced analytics and emerging technologies into their existing or future products, workflow or supply chain etc. Then VOILA! Your journey begin


## Introduction
People often get confused with the differences between Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and how it relates to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Here is one diagram I made *(inspired from Nvidia)*:
![](https://github.com/didiooi/beginnersguideML/blob/master/AI%20ML%20DL.png)
*In short, Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which is a subset of AI.*

There is also another way to view this: **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**. Supervised Learning includes Machine Learning while Unsupervised Learning includes Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

### Behind the Hype: Terminologies Explained

  Data Science: Extraction of knowledge and information from data, using integrated ideas from Mathematics, Statistics, Machine Learning, Computer Science, and Subject Matter Expertise (SME).
  Big Data: Unstructured data from multiple sources arriving at an alarming **Velocity, Volume and Variety** and in format in which meaningful value and information is not leveraged from (yet). Machine Learning (ML): A field in computer science whereby the algorithm has the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  
  Statistical Learning: Branch of applied statistics recently emerge in response to ML, emphasizing statistical models and assessment of uncertainty.  
 Deep Learning: A computational method for implementing machine learning using artificial neural network by building multiple layers of abstraction to solve complex semantic problems.

 All of these are very similar but have different emphases.

## Programming Language
[**Python**](https://www.python.org/) is the fastest growing language because of how dynamic and readable it is, so I'd suggest getting started with the basics of it.  
Read '[Python overtakes R, becomes the leader in Data Science, Machine Learning platforms](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/08/python-overtakes-r-leader-analytics-data-science.html)'

**Important Python Tools, Libraries**  
[Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)  
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)  
[Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org)  

## Practice 
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Forking from existing [GitHub](https://www.github.com) repositories

## Learning Resources
Andrew Ng's Stanford [**Machine Learning** course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is a great place to start if you already have a strong science and math background. For more theoretical background behind Statistical Learning, which is an advanced branch of statistics invented in conjunction with Machine Learning, your best bet will be [**Introduction to Statistical Learning**](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) If you want the classic beginner's guide to ML and needs some refresher with math, definitely go to Chris Bishop's [**Pattern Recognition**](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf). 

## Deep Learning
- For **Deep Learning**, there is no other place to start with than Ian Goodfellow et al's [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book.
- [Neural Network Zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/) - cheat sheet containing for most architectures  
- [Neural Network playground with TensorFlow](http://playground.tensorflow.org) - a web app that lets you play with a real neural network running in your browser and click buttons and tweak parameters to see how it works. If you are unsure of what pressing all that buttons mean, read [Google's blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/07/understanding-neural-networks-with-tensorflow-playground)

## Reinforcement Learning

## Not-so Basic Data Science
If you're feeling extra adventurous and would love to learn more theoretical and mathematical background, try Hastie's [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

## News
1. [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/)  
2. Following the right people on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/didiooi/following) (Most of the people I follow on my Twitter are at the forefront of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning realm)  
3. [Medium](https://medium.com) Short reads on all sorts of topics, including ML, DL, robotics (make sure to personalize your feed first)

## Help
[StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/): to ask for help in any data science or programming problems

## Side Note
The key takeaways that I have learned:
1. You do not need to know advanced coding to get into Data Science or Machine Learning etc, do it from top-down
2. Data Science and its tools is **NOT magic**! You should remain skeptical and vigilant. Good data and proper internal validation is required.
